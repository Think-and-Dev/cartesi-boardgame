# Game Client Logic

The game client logic is responsible for managing the state and interactions of the game on the client side. This includes handling the game state (G) and context (ctx) to ensure smooth gameplay and accurate representation of the game status. In our implementation, we utilize the **Dapp Transport** module to facilitate communication between clients.
