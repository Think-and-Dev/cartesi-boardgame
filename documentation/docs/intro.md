# Cartesi Boardgame

### Introduction to Cartesi Boardgame Library

Cartesi Boardgame is a game library that transforms turn-based board game development by integrating blockchain validation for secure and transparent outcomes. Inspired by boardgame.io, this library empowers developers to build digital board games with ease, leveraging Cartesi's infrastructure. It simplifies the creation of game logic, state management, and player interactions, all within a robust and scalable environment optimized for blockchain integration.

### What is Cartesi?

[Cartesi](https://cartesi.io/) is a layer-2 platform that bridges the gap between blockchain and traditional software development. It allows developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) using mainstream programming languages, while benefiting from blockchainâ€™s security and transparency. By enabling off-chain computation and scalable solutions, Cartesi empowers dApps with complex logic, lower costs, and faster processing times, all while preserving the decentralization and trustless nature of blockchain.

### Boardgame.io Integration and Key Differences

Our library is inspired by [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/documentation/#/), retaining many of its core features. Developers familiar with boardgame.io will find the same intuitive structure and ease of use. However, key differences arise due to our integration with Cartesi, introducing new functionalities like blockchain validation, secure storage, and randomness. These unique aspects will be detailed further in section Architecture, providing a comprehensive overview of how our library extends boardgame.io's capabilities.
